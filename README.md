# Constant Melody X
 *Version 1.3*
 
## What?
 This is a modification of [NotITG's default theme](https://github.com/TaroNuke/Simply-Love-NotITG-ver.-/).
 You will need the theme installed for this one to work.

## âš  The theme looks weird!
 This might be due to the default simply love theme having different folder names (why).
 Open `metrics.ini` and replace the `FallbackTheme` under `[Global]` to the name of the default theme's folder

## Why?
 i need more ponies in my life

## What features does it have?
 1. RPC Support (see: `~ Discord RPC - Py ~/` for more info).
 2. Mid-file pausing! (Currently will break if you press `Start` to exit, use the same keybind).
 3. Break Time screen! (aka music player)
 4. ponies
 5. ponies
 6. ponies
 7. more ponies
 8. even more ponies
 9. might want to check `Extra Options` for more, idk honestly

## What features does it change?
 1. Fail overlay needs to be set up using `Options > Extra Options`.
 2. 
 3. uh

This theme is OpenITG & NotITG (v1 - v4.0.1) compatible.
Certain features will be disabled, depending on what you're using.
